# Problem

How long would each of these operations take in Big O notation?

- Printing the value of each element in an array.
  O(n)

- Doubling the value of each element in an array.
  O(n)

- Doubling the value of just the first element in an array.
  O(1)

- Creating a multiplication table with all the elements in the array. So if your array is [2, 3, 7, 8, 10], you first multiply every element by 2, then multiply every element by 3, then by 7, and so on.
  O(n^2)
