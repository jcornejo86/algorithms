# Dynamic programming

A technique to solve a hard problem by breaking it up into subproblems and solving those subproblems first.

Dynamic programming only works when each subproblem is discrete—when it doesn’t depend on other subproblems.

# Key Notes

- Every dynamic-programming solution involves a grid.
- The values in the cells are usually what you’re trying to optimize. For the knapsack problem, the values were the value of the goods.
- Each cell is a subproblem, so think about how you can divide your problem into subproblems. That will help you figure out what the axes are.


# Recap
- Dynamic programming is useful when you’re trying to optimize something given a constraint.
- You can use dynamic programming when the problem can be broken into discrete subproblems.
- Every dynamic-programming solution involves a grid.
- The values in the cells are usually what you’re trying to optimize.
- Each cell is a subproblem, so think about how you can divide your problem into subproblems.
- There’s no single formula for calculating a dynamic-programming solution.
